# Introduction

## Objectives
1- Predict the user skip comportment given a session of music, based in 'Spotify Skip Prediction Challenge'[1]

2- Compare the supervised learning methods seen in class.

## Approach
Create an algorithm em python able to predict user skip comportment given a session of music, using several methods of
supervised machine learning presented during the class.

Will be used as base articles:

**Preliminary Investigation of Spotify Sequential Skip Prediction Challenge** - Charles T., which describe the spotify
skip prediction challenge.  
Available at: https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/jianzhongq/wsdm19-cup-reports/reports/report17.pdf

**The Music Streaming Sessions Dataset** - Brian B., Rishabh M., Tristan J. which describe the dataset created for this
challenge.  
Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.09851.pdf


And will be consulted too, articles of participants of this challenge that had published something, where we can find
specific approaches for solution of this problem and get some hyperparams values, such as:

**Modelling Sequential Music Track Skips using a Multi-RNN Approach** - Christian H., Casper H.,
Stephen A., Jakob G. S., Christina L.  
Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.08408.pdf

**Skip prediction using boosting trees based on acoustic features of tracks in sessions** - Andrés F.,
Dmitry B., Xavier S.  
Available at: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1903.11833.pdf


Some algorithms of learning was not used by people that participate of challenge, soon there's not articles about,
however at this project we have the objective of use they for comparison purposes, even though we know that the
performance will be worse, such as Knn.
